# YouTube Clone

## Important:
Don't run the local server as the `.env` file is not shared publicly.

Instead, go to the directory `client/` and follow these steps:
1. Create a `.env` file.
2. Add the following variable:
<<<<<<< HEAD
```sh
REACT_APP_BASE_URL = https://some-backend.vercel.app/
=======
```sh
REACT_APP_BASE_URL = https://some-backend.vercel.app/
```
3. Now you being, in the `client/` directory, you can start the react server using
```sh
npm run start
```

## Disclaimer:
```sh
Since this is deployed using free deployment tools ( Vercel and Render).
The API I have built is not fast enough as it is deployed on the free version of the mentioned deployment tool.
Also, do not upload any media exceeding 100MB!
>>>>>>> upstream/main
```
3. Now you being, in the `client/` directory, you can start the react server using
```sh
npm run start
```

## Disclaimer:
Since the backend URL provided to you all, is made just for you all, you are restricted from uploading any video while in development, as the clone has the feature for uploading a video.

## For loggin-in use the following details:
```sh
Email: devcode@ytclone.com,
Password: test1234
```

This is the YouTube clone I am building.
I am building this clone to practice MERN. I am making sure that the UI of this app is identical to the real one.

The UI of this clone is built using React, react-redux, MaterialUI, and Redux-toolkit-query.

The backend of the project is made using NodeJS, and Express. The database for all the models used in this app is MongoDB and all the media is stored in Cloudinary.

[ Update: The UI of this clone is now outdated because while building ( as of Oct 23 ) the UI YouTube updated its UI on Nov 23 ]
